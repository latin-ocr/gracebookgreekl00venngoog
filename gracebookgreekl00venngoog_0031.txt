pp. 207, 8. The incident referred to at Issicester arose out oi a
sermon by W. Hughes, Lsdy Margaret Preacher. He had
impugned the doctrine, De Dasccosu Christi ad inferos (v.
Oooper, Ananis, 11. 231).

p. 241: gr. 2. The ordinance of King Edward IV ior the founda
tion oi Ohantry priests at Windsor is given in Gracc Book A,
p. 160.

p. 256: gr. 7. Adam Holiday belongs to the class afterwards
known as “ten-year-men.'' They were first specifically pro
vided ior in the Statntes oi Edward VI: but the privilege oi
obtaining the B.D. without previous graduation in Arte had
long been enjoyed by monks and triers, in acconenses is
supposed, with Stat. Aac. 107.

p. 261: gr. 2. The prootors’ negative vote. The Statutes oi 1572
greatly curtailed the power of the prootors, but I cannot
find in them any definite reference oi this kind. Nor does
the long list oi contemporary Objcctioas, published in Iamb’s
Documenta, seem to help us.

p. 266: gr. 5. Dr Pennock refers (p. 3) to this grace as “showing
that the authority oi the Senate with respect to the ancient
statutes was considered at that time to be in no respect
diminished by the new system oi laws'': ie. by the
Elisabethan Statutes just introduced.

p. 345: gr. l. This grace seems, as Pcacock suggests, an indication
of some recent irregularity, as it declares nothing but what
was already statutable. The consent oi the Caput had long
been necessary.

at the Mn. inception‚ to the Tripos at the B.A., he “was
appointed for this duty at the commencement oi the pre
ceding year, having been swern the last (though one oi the
first called) on that occasion, and being consequently the
junior regent....So named from varying the question which
he proposed, either by a play upon the words‚’' or otherwise.
Dr Peacock gives an example, by Jamcs Duport, oi one
oi these exercises (Appendic, p. xxvii).

p. 347. The selection of the Earl oi Essex ior the Oopat is a
unique instance of such an appointment.

p. 352: gr. l. The case oi N. Bestney, of King's, deserves notice.
He was a foundationen scholar, and icllow, but he was
treated exactly like studente oi other collegas.
