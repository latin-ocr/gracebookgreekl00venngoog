x INTRODUOTION

regularly appointed every year at the same time aethe proeters;
and it is difficult to imagine examinem making their order 01
precedence one in which ‘⁴ merit '' was not recognised. There are
occasional 1111111011 to them aa iar back as 11104 (Γ, p. 34). But
110111 lest-6 the rule iethet two “oppeciere'’ or “examinatores
questionistarum'’ (commonly called “ρο1111”) should be appointed
by grace The list 01 these annual examinare is given in the
Appendix. Who it was who actually placed the men in their
order, 11 not quite plain. The phrase always used is that the place
occupied 11 that “quem ei pater assignavit ”3 the “lether'' being
one 01 the proctors, generally the senior proctor. But the grace
about the examinare (p. 360) shows that their duties were 11110111.
Probably the likeliest viewis that the pater acted on their advice.
Stokys' phrase is, “then shall the proctors appoint them their
seniority ’¹ :-as ia well known, the proctors had the right, down tc
quite late times, to place some 01 their personal friends where they
pleased in the list (v. Peacock‚ App. p. ix.; and W. W. R. Ball,
Oricia aad History of 1111 111111110ιί011 Tricca).

Aga'm, iiwe teet the subsequent career 01 the graduates, I think
it will be found that on the whole those high in the list were the
more distinguished in aiter life. To give hutone instance—ae
illustration not 11 proce-John Oaiua headed the Ordo inhia year.
There 11 another indication telling in the same direction. 'lhrough-
out Gracc Book E, and oiten in later years, only the names 01 the
1111200130111 placed in order: the others are omitted, with the
statement that seniorityis given to them “as they have it in their
Oolleges'’ (1627-8). And, where their names are given, those 01
the same (lollege are frequently bracketed together. 'l'he first
20 01 30 names are evidently treated in a very different manner
110111 the others. It must be remembered that the Ordo was quite
11 important 101 the M.A. as 101· the B.A.: 1111101, 01 the two, the
10111111 11 the more fully and regularly preserved. For the B.D.
the same 101111 is used, “The father shall assign them ae he will
have them in seniority'’ (Peacock, App. xxxviii..)

There can be little doubt, that the original and dominant idea
was simply that 01 assigning precedence. The higher degrees would
naturally precede the lower, aa senior men would go before junior5
but, as regards men 01 the same year, some other ground 01 decision
was called 101. Where men live together, and especially where they
take part in processione and compete 101 cilices-aa we may see in
