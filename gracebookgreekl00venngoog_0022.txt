letter 51 congratulation sant to him by the University is printed in

Lamb’a Documenta (p. 167). We soon find such greces as this
(p. 100) that the ViceOhanoellor and certain other doctors
“Oxoniam proficiscantur ad propugnandam veram et catholicam
fidem et contrariam doctrinm impugnandam ”: their mission, as
will be remembered, was to confuta Omnmer, Ridley and Latimer,
before their martyrdom. Degrees in Oarion Law, as already pointed
out, begin to be revived. In February, 1556-7, took place the

strange procedure 51 the exhumation 51 155 bodies 51 Buoer and
Pagina, their condemnation for heresy‚ and their public burning in

the Marketplace. Alter Stephon Gordiner’s death 15 1553, 5 51111

as Chaucellor.

Very many 51 the changes which mark this period, 51 course, are
not recorded in the Gracc Book: for instance those which concern
the mastership of the Oollegea. Others are likely to escape notice;
thus on looking closely at the names 51 155 holders 51 various offices,
we may observe the total absence 51 many which frequently recur
in the preceding and succeeding reigns. 0115555 perhaps Matthew
Parker was the most distinguished, but there were many other
exiles from Cambridge besides the future Archbishop.

Then came the final change, so lar as we are concerned, when
Queen Mary, and her cousin the Cardinal Ohancellor, died about
the same time, November, 1558. The new Ohancellor was Sir
William Oecil, an appointment of the type which has 5555 adhered
to ever since in Cambridge, that, namely, 51 the great lay nobleman.
The Vionbancellor, Edmund Oosyn, Master of St Catharine's,
almost immediately resigned 1551511155, together with the master-
ship, and retired into private 1115 aa a tellowcommoner at Gaius.
Soon atter, the reformed order is publicly displayed by a grace
(p. 139), for cancelling the decree about Bucer and Fagius. The
deceased divinos are duly restored to their degrees and titles 51
honour.
