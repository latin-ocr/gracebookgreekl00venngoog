College and 10 the University, received the congratulatione 01 the

- University 00 hia appointment to the Archbishopric 01 Oanterbury.

10 1586 0 grace was passed (p. 405) ior allowing Emmanuel
Oollege'to take its place with the other Oolleges.

In the same year a grace was passed (p. 404) ior prohibiting
booksellers from buying any book printed in London, which had been,
or should be, printed in Oxiord or Cambridge.

10 1581 the chronic disputes between the University and the
Town seem 10 have risen 10 00 unusual height, and gracoe are
passed 10 meet the “intollerabilis adversus Academiam et academicos
ingratitudo ’' which the Townsmen displayed (pp. 415-9). For
further references 10 this, and the other permanent trouble 01
medieval times-the Plagae-see the Index.

11 may be noted that the Appellota'oua, or Appeals‚ 01 which
a list 10 given in the Index, were mostly from the decisione 01 the
Ohancellor’s Oourt. By the Eliaabethan Statutes, irem three to
five delegates were appointed by the caper and the proctors.
By ancient custom they had been appointed by the regente and

foundationers-as distinguished from other members-obtained the
B.A. and Mn. without any university examination. They com-
peted ior most 01 the classieal scholarehips and prinas, but till 1853

their names never appear in the Tripos lists. This state 01 things
had existed for very many years.. But two points have, 00 iar,
baffled enquiry: (1) By what right was this privilege obtainedl
(2) From what period does it (10101 These questions puzrled
Peacock in 1841, and Μι- Αο0100 Leigh, some sixty years later,
when writing the history 01 his college, could throw no light upon
them. Peacoclr is inclined to believe that there was no legal or
statutable authority whatever for the privilege. In 1001 he quotes,
