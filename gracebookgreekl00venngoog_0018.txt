This seems to show that the view-almost ruriversally held in
Cambridge till recent times, and still widely prevalent-that the
recipient ol the MJ). should have been well grounded in Arts
b'eiore specialising in Medicine, was already established in the days
ol Dr (laius.

Next as to the M.B. This certainly seems to heve been intended
to representa real degree, but one of a less literory kind than the
M.D. The words of the Elisabethen Statute ol 1572 are as follows:
“Medicinae studiosus sex annos rem medicam discet, ejus lectionis
auditor assiduus: anatomiae duas videat: bis respondeat, semel
opponat, antequam bacalaureus fiat.” That is to say, a previous

ζ’ Ἀηε degree was not required.

As a mutter oi fect this degree was by uo meone popular. At
the present day, as we all know, it is the usual portal through
which the M.D. is approached. Iu 1908, ior instance, there were
46 ol them ae against 27 M. D. But throughout the whole 47 years
included in Grece Book Δ, Ι cen only find three oi these M.B.; of

What seems to have usually taken the place of the Μ.Β. was the
licente to practice. Of these there were two, one in medicine and
the other in surgery‚ which we may briefly indicate by M. L. and eL
Here there seems some difficulty, which Ι have not succeeded in
completely clearing up.

The difficulty lies in reconciling the words ol the statutes with
those ol the Gracc Books, and with the customs which seem aetuelly
to have prevailed. The tormer seem to contemplate only three
claeses; numely M.D., Μ.Β. (see the statute quoted above, heeded
Dc studiosis Mediciuce), and the licence top1·uctisesurgery(heeded
De dedices clirnrpioe)¹. The last runs thus: “ Chirurgiae studiosus
duas anatomias iaciat: tres ud minimum curationes se fecisse probet,
antequam admittetur ad praxin chirurgioe.'’ These statutes certainly
seem to me to contemplate only three divisione, namely two degrees,
and the licence to practice surgery. They imply thet the “studiosus

lsratura Elisabethoe, Nos. XV and XVI. 1 quote from the Elisabethen
statutos, becauoe they seem clearer in their expression. lt must be mmembcred
that their provisions not only provailed down to recent times, but covered
almost the whole period with which we are concerned3 lor the temporary
Edwsrdian Statutes, and those cl 1559, are almost identical se regards the
matter in question. The Statumantiqac are rather obscure on this point, but

they seem on the whole to melre more distinction than the later statutes‘
