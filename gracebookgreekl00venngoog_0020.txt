INTRODUUI’ION xv

and therefore became more popular. But how it was reoognised in
the statute I do not see. Nor can Iascertain, whether the. licenee
was recognised 00 0 “degree '’ by other Uniyersities ; though the
acceptance of Mr Butler hythe Collega of Physicians is a strong
case.

The main outlines 01 History, national and academicae 101 as
they are illustrated in 11110 volume, must be very hrIefly sketched.
We open with the final years 01 Henry VIII, after his quarrel with
the Papacy. The old refigion was unchanged in essentiale, and
such a strenuous supporter of Rome as Stephon Gardiner continued
in the Chanccllorship. But 0011011 Law was 0110110101,Ι and in
consequence 01 the suppression 01 the Monasten'es one numerous
and conspicuous clement, both in University and Oellege life—the
mouks and hiera-had finally disappeared.

With the accession 01 Edward VI (Jan. 28, 1546-7) the first
decisivo indicatione 01 the Reformation 10001110 apparent. In the
course of the year the king’s uncle, Edward Seymour, Duke of
Somerset, became Ohancellor in place of Gardiner. We then see
such indicatione 01 change as the sale 01 the University processional

appraisers (p. 61); Martin Bucer, the eminent reformer, is created
D.D.; J. E. TremellIus, another foreign 101010101, 10 appointed
Hebrevr professor (p. 74).

Then 001110 the short fortnight of the unfortunate Lady Jane
Grey, the dramatic soenes 01 which are so closely connected with
Cambridge. Edward VI died June 6, 1553. A few days afterwards,
the Duke 01 Nerthumberland, Ohancellor 01 1110 University and
Ledy Jane’s father-in-law, arrived in Cambridge, and directed the
ViceOhancellor, Dr Sandys, to preach on the occasion at St Mary's
Church. Two or three days afterwards, just as the sermon was to
be sent up to London for publication, news came that the cause 01
Lady June had collapsed. The Duke, who had returned from
Suffollr, and the ViceChancellor‚ hurried into the marhot-place and

proclaimed Quaen Mary. Then followed the scene so graphically
described by Ferret The Vice-Ohancellor, who was walking in the
