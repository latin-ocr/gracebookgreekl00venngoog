The Bachelor and Doctor oi Divinity heve remained practically
unchanged, as regards requirements and significanee, with one
exception. The old expression in common usa ior the Β.Ι). was
thet he was admitted “ad intrandum libros Sententiarum.'' By
the Royal Injunotions referred to in the grace oi 1543-4 (p. 17)
lecturus on Peter Lombard were forbiddeu3 and the phrase is
generally dropped except when applied to pest degrees‚ or during
the Marion period. The degrees in Theology were naturally much
more numerous, relatively‚ at a time when the great majority oi
graduates toolr orders, and when most Oollege statutos required that
a iellow should in due course proceed to Β.Ι).

The degrees in civil Law are probably about as numerous as
they were in the preceding Gracc Boolrs. Aa they are always
described as being Oivil Low, I heve indicated them by the letters
B.O.L aud D.O.L Iu modern times they were commonly repre
sented by LL.B. and LLD, which seems to have given riso
(owing to the double letters) to a belief that the Oanon law,
though abolished in icet, was still retained in the name. From the
first the Rom seems to have ranked almost, 11 not quite, as the
equivalent ο1 the M.A. in Arte. It was seldom conferred till aiter
six or seven years oi study; end men were elected to lellowships
at ihinity Hall occasionally beiore they had actually taken the
degree„

As to Medicina, a lew words must be said. It is another sign
oi Modernism that degrees in this faculty are becoming iar more
common. Throughout the whole 42 years included in Grace Book
Γ, only oue Mb, oue M.B., and eight licences to practisa are
recorded. In Δ we have a total ο1 124, including uo less thau 63
who proceeded to M.D.

In regard to the higher degree, that oi Doctor, there does not
seem any difficulty. By statute (Statato 1111ιὶ91111, uo. 90)Ι the MD.
was granted to those only who had already taken the M.A., besides
having devoted five years’ study to the subject. These requirements
seem to have beon adhered to fairly closely. Of the 63 M.D.'s, no
less than 54 were M.A. and three B.A.; three others were in-
corporatione irom ioreign Universitiea This leaves only three oi
whom we can say, that they had not taken an Arte degree: two oi
these were already MR. aud the third held the licence to practise.

¹ The correspondlng Elisabethan statmo makes llttls change here, beyond
extending the tima ol study to aaran years.
