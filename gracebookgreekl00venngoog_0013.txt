was always secured, for the regent would very seldom be more than
25 years old¹. Τ110 principal complaint urged in later days seems
10 have applied 10 an abuse 01 the method of electiori by which, in
practice, only those members were elected who were proposed by the
ViccOhanoellor: in other words, the Heads had the entire control
(v. 1101110900 Hierony, 11. 223).

Perhaps the word caper is answerable for the 1101101 which
seems to have been held by some persons, that that body consisted
01 0 ‘⁴ lot 01 old Heads.'' In both respecta such an opinion is
singularly wide 01 the mark. 'l'he present Oouncil 111001 have five
Heads 3 four elected, and the ViceChancellor 3 the old oopus need
not have had one, 101 even the ViceOhaneellor was not always 01
that order. As 0 matter 01 fact it sometimes included only one.
In regard to the age 01 the members the readcr is referred 10 the
0010 above.

Another striking instance 01 the continuity 01 the present and
the pest is 10 be found 1011101010000 lists, known in old days as thc
0010010100, and in later days as the Mathematical Tripoa,
which are recorded almost without omission 11010 1491 down 10
1909. This particular statement will need some explanation, as
many persons will be inclined 10 claim 101 the class list 01 1910 an
identity with that 01 1909, whilst others will question our right 10
identify the ancient Ordo with the recent familiar Tripcs. The
answer is that 000 clement, and one 01010001 only, can be traced
right through 1110 whole series down 10 last year. This was the
placing 01 the men in individual order3 and this clement, as we all
know, was abclished by recent regulation. Γ111111100 00 definite
bresch oi continuity can be detected through the lapse 01 more than
1001 centurias. 01 course 11 we bring into juxtaposition two lists, a
century or two apert, 101 the purpose 01 comparisorr, we shall find
the differences between them very great, but 11 we examine them

conclude that the average age 01 the (lapid 01 that year was just thirty-one.
