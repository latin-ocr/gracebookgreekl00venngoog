equivalent expression, in general use for these degrees from 1528-9.
Βο1010 that date, the King's B.A. degreee are seldom mentioned in
the list of greces, which, of course, looks as if there was something
exeeptional about them. The MA. degreeS, on the other hand,
generally are recorded ; and, where recorded, it is significant that the
expression used is exactly the sameas for members 01 other colleges.
There are many of these between 1510 and 1528, 10 which it is
expressly stated that the candidate had attended the ordinary
lectores and performed the usual responsione. The B.A. degree,
however, is 001 always omitted, and where it is recorded the
customary expression is used. Take the csse of S. Simonds, Β.Α.
1508-9, a foundationer and 1011011. 11 10 plainly stated 11011110 hed
kept 1110 usual oppositione and responsione, 010. His grace is in
every way identical with those referring to other collegas.

It seems therefore that 1110 0001010 01 claiming exemptione began
10 prevail about 1510-25, but that examination was not avoided till
much later.
