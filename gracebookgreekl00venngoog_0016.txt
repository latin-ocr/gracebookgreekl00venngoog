every regiment‚ college, and school—there must be some means of
deciding at once as to “seniority,'' if we are to avoid friction end
dispute The results of examinatior were probably used, not eo
much es an end in themselves, es a convenient means of sssigning
this precedeuce.

We cannot quit this particular topic without making a passing
reference to the only other University examination which can be
put in compurison with the Cambridge one. It ie thet which
prevciled at the old University of Louvain. In some respccts this
latter stood distinctly higher. It appears to have been, from the
first, universelly recognised as an “order of merit,” s position to
which, as we have seen, our Tripos only slowly and gradually
attained. Moreover it was considerably the older of the two, the
Louvain lists being almost continuone from 14281. But this
examination come to sn end, with the old University, in 1793; so
that in respect of duretion it must take the second place.

As to the degrees recorded in our Greoe Book, they are, with
two exceptione, those with which we ore familiar at the present
dey. These exceptione refer to Cenon Lew and to Gremmar.
Degrees in the former were sbolished‚ together with the academic
study of the Faculty, by the Royel Injunctions of 1535 3 as a result
of Henry VIII's dispute with the Pope They were revived-
presumably in accordence with the injunctions of the Queen -during
the brief Marian reection; three such degrees will bo found on
peges 105, ll4, 118. In the cese of Hugh Griffyn (p. 114) it is
expressly stated, thet in the absence of any doctor of the Canon
Iew he was to be presented by a doctor of the civil Inw. As
a reference to the earlier Gracc Books will show, canon Law degraes
were a favouritc resource with the more ambitione ecclesiastice, end
especially with the Monks. At the suppression of the monaster-ies,
of course the supply of the letter cluss of studente came at once to
an end. As to the degrees in Grnmmnr, there wes apparently no
legishtion: they seem to have simply fallen into dhuse in com-
parison with themora popular Arte degrees Ifiud only two such
recorded, namely on peges 1 and 48. In the previous Gracc Book
there were 37.

As regards some of the other degrees very little need be said.
