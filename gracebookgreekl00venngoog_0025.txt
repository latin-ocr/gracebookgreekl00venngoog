came in for much discussion and criticiam. They are camhdly
analyzed and described in Deun Peaeock's obseruatione, the most
important passages in which are reproduced 10 Oooper’s sanan.
Their general effect was greatly 10 increase the power of the Heads,
both in the University and in their own Oolleges; and greatly 10
diminish the importasse of the Caput as a reflection of the opinion
of the resident graduates (see back, p. x). The authority of the
proctors was much curtailed, and instead of being freely elected by
the regents they were to be nominated in a cycle by the Oolleges.
Stringent restrictione were imposed upon the power 01 the
University to grant any degrees except those allowed by the

¹ standard regulations. It was ior this reason that whenever what

came to be called an honorary degree was granted, it was generally
considered requisite to obtain “royal letters'' or a mandate.

The grace 00 p. 284 concerning the “University street '³ refers
to the gift oi Archbishop Parker. He made a new road from
opposite St Mary's Ohuroh to the Public Schools, removing a
number 01 small houscs for the purpose, “thatso a more handsome
sight might be 01 the Public Schools” (Strype, Purher, 11. 406).
The deed of gift is printed in Mr Olark's Eadcunncats.

One of the early intimations 01 the increasing importunes of the
Public Library is afforded by the grace of J uly 10, 1577: “ Maye it
plesse you to ratifye the stipend of xli lymited ior the heper of the
librarye ’² (p. 304) ¹. Four years later there was 0 grace for exacting

contributions from 011 graduates towards the payment 01 the · r

librarian (p. 345). In 1586 (p. 414) reference is made 10 0 large
prospective increase by gifts 01 books from generous donors.

The ancient and stately University ceremonial as displayed in
the frequent processions-so dear to the heart of Dr Caius—had
presumably somewhat dropped into desuetude‚ along with the
discmded cross. The insistence on the due observance of “scarlet
days ” seems to indicate 0 reviving interest 10 lay ceremonial (p. 312).

In 1580 new 00010 were made for the University and for the
office oi Chancellor (pp. 343, 344).

10 1583 11 appears that the increasing numbers of students and
consequently much enlarged Ordo, demanded fresh legislation as to
the payment and duties 01 the examiners (p. 360). Ιο the same
year Matthew Perker, the great benefactor to Corpus Christi

¹ hs Dr H. P. Stolos shows (Chcplcius, pp. 29, 39), the Univsraity Ohaplaiu
000, 10 early times, the Kespcr of the Library.
