The constitution 01 the University, 101 executive purpoeee‚ had
0100 become nearly lixed by lew end by 01010111. The chief executivc

officer, the ViceOhancellor, wes¹ almost invericbly chosen 110111
smongst the Heeds 01 Honses, 0011010 to this dey. The Ohencellor
wes always 001110 nobleman 01 high dignity. Iu early days he had
often been 01 ecclesiastic. Τ110 lest 01 this type was Stephon
Gardiner, who wes reeppointed during the brief Marion reection.
Η10 successor, Oardinal Reginuld Pole, son 01 Margaret, Lady
Selisbury, and, through her, 01 royul extraction, scercely belongs to
the mere 00010010011001 order. With the 0100110101 Sir W. 00011,
[ord Burghley, in 1559, 1110 modern usage 1100011100 firmly esteb
lished.

The executive body, 00 101 00 we 0011 call it 00, in the University,
1100 the Caput. ’1110 first 1010101100 10 this body in the Gracc
Books, 00 101001 can ascertain, 10 in 1526. The first reference
10 the name by which it 1100 elweys afterwards known 0001110 10 be
in 1547-8, when we read “ in capite ut vocent '’ (p. 53). It consisted
01 the VicoOhancellor (in absence 01 the Ohancellor); three doctore
in Divinity, Law, end Medicine respectively 3 0 non-regent ; end 0
regent. The 1001 01 these, being an M.A. 01 1101 more then three
011011 years standing², represented the junior clement. The non-
regent member was 011 Mn. 01 0011101 standing, or, very frequently
a B.D.⁸ This executive body wes only superseded by the present
“ (10111011 01 the Senote'’ during the 10101110 introduced ‚in 1860.
I have given 0 1101 01 110 members 10100011 known year in the
Appendix.

In criticising such a scheme 00 this 01 the capet, we heve

obviously to distinguish between the 11100 and the way in which
they were worked. In 110011 the arrangement does not seem a bed
one. In two respects, indeed, it seems sounder then the present
arrangement: 11101111 respect thet the check against purtiality hed
in view, not colleges or University status but semeitica Esoh 01
the three 1100111100 1100 duly represented. Agein 0 youthtul member

these was Dr J. Oopcct (loeo-7), who, though he 111011101ᾱο became Mester 01
