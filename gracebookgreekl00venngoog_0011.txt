Τ110 text has been printed 110111 0 transcript made by Mr A
Rogers, 01 the University Library, collated with the original by
myself. For frequent help, and various suggestions, I heve to thanis
the kindnese of Mr W. G. Searle and Dr H. P. Stokes.

The pretatory dutiae 01 successive editors 01 these Craoa Books
grow gradually simpler and sasier. To Mr Stanley leathes 1011 1110
difficult taslr 01 explaining, 101· Book A, the methodo and the
phraseology 01 0 medieval system. The first steps in the change
towards Modernism, 00 illustrated 1οΒ and P, have been admirably
discussed by Mise M. Bateson, in the two volumee edited by her 3 and
by the Rev. W. G. Searle and Mr J. W. Clark, the late Registrary‚
in the volume edited by the former. In Graca Book Δ we find
ourselves‚ at any rate aiter the first 1011 years, in whet 10, so 101 aa
outward form is concerned, the Cambridge 01 recent times3 that is,
Cambridge aa senior members 01 the University can still remember
it. As this statement may seem rather strange to some 01 001
readers, a short explanation may be advisable

When we talk 01 outward form here, we are referring to Iaws
and Phraeeology; and Laws and Phraseology, it need hardly be
said, may remain unaltered, notwithstanding very extensive changes
01 interpretation and 01 00010111, It is theold contrast between
the Letter and the Spirit. Το begin with the constituent elementa
01 1110 Univereity as a whole, namely the Collegae: here we
’ have essentially the modern system. Almost from the commence
ment oi this volume, 14 01 the 17 Colleges, which practically
composed the University until 1860, were not merely in existence,
but were, in every sense in which identity can be predicated 0100011
institutione, the seme 00 they are now. Only one, Conville Hall,
has even changed its name on its enlargement. And with this
exception, the statutas under which the Collegae were then governed
remained, I believe, almost unaltered until the Commission 01 sixty
years ago.

These Collegae, 111011,οε 101 three centurias to corne, practioally
constituted the whole Univereity3 and their Heads ware already
acquiring that propenderent power in University affairs against
whieh the Commission 01 1856 legislated. The Hostels were 1001
dying out, and aiter 1550 they played an extremely small part in
Academica] 1110 Ι believe 11101 there is not a single reference to
any one 01 1110111 10 the whole 01 this volume.
