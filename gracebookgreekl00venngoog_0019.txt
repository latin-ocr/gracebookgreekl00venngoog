medicinse” will naturally become Μ.Β., whilst the “ studiosus
chirurgiae” will obtain, not a degree, but only a licence.

When, however, we turn to the Gracc Books, we find four
divisione: namely the above three, and the “licence to practice
medicine ” as distinguished from the Μ.Β. The wording of the
greces in the two cases is quite distinct 3 in the form for Μ.Β. the

candidate is admitted “ad intrandum,” in that for Mn “ad
practicandum.'' And tha hesdinge in the Gracc Book mark tha

same distinction. Thus on p. 291, Peter Cottio, admitted ad
praeliandum, stands under the heading “ Practicans in Medicina ”5
whilst, immediately after him, John Bishope, admitted ad intrandam,
is duly described as “ Bacchalaureua iu Medicina.''

When we look to what was deneas distinguished from what
was said, it certainly seems to support the view that the Μ.Β. or
licence to practise Medicms, was regarded ae the equivalent ol the
Μ.Β. It was much the more popular qualificatiou, lor we find 41 ot
them aa against the three who took Μ.Β. And in popular estima
tion no differcnce seems to have been recognised. The most striking
instance in point is afforded by the lamous William Butler of Olare
Hall, whose medical reputation extended tar and wide. He was
generally called “Dr Butler,'' but his only qualification was this
licence. When application was made by the Chaucellor to that
jealous body, the Collega oi Physicians, that Butler might be
allowed to practice occasionally on his visits to London, his title
was recognised and permission was granted. The Chancellor terms
him “Mr Butler, Professor ol Physic”: tha Collega terme him
“Dr Butler ’' (O. Goodall, Proceadiuqa against llntpirica, p. 335).

Similarly, when we loolr at the career ot the candidates, we lind
a bmad difference between tha holders oi the medical and surgical
licences. The former are much the more academie. Of the 41 no
less than 25 had¹ graduated in arte, and of these 12 subsequently
proceeded to the Mb. Ol those who held the surgical licences,
17 in number, only three appear to have taken an Arts degree.

The technical distinction between the Μ.Β. aud the ML. seems
to be, that iu the former case the candidate had, in accordance with
the statute, to keep his act and opponencies, though in one ol the
three cases (W. Keuyngham, p. 118) there is no mention of anything
more than examinatior. In the latter case he uuderwent an ex·
emination by two doctore specified iu the grace. The usual torm
is “ut ejus eruditio et cognitio prius examinentur et approbentur
