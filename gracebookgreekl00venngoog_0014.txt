year by year the differences will be found quite insignificant. The
subjecte oi examinatiom ior instance, were gradually changed. In
early days they were wholly what we should now call philosophical:
in course oi time they became wholly mathematical. But the
change took place almost insensibly ; by small innovatione on the
part of examinare rather than by deliberate intention on the part oi
the legislatore. At first the names were arranged in one single
list: the division into “wranglers,” “ senior optimas,” and “junior
optimas,'’ was oi later introduction.

But the most important transformation was one about which it

seems to have been contemplated than an “order oi seniority ”z this
remained the technical designation till quite recent times, and hae,
in ieet, never been abandoned. But the liet subsequently claimed
to be, and was universally recognised as being, an “order oi merit.”
“Honours,” and all else which this implies, were determined by a
men's place in the list. Now when did this remarkable change take
placei All that I can say is that it seems to have developed during
the first hali oi the eighteenth century1. It is oi course nearly
certain that some notion oi merit, iu the sense oi intellectual
superiority‚ must have been recognised all along; at least so ier as
the men towards the top of the list are concerned. Several con·
siderations support this view. For instance, amnem were
